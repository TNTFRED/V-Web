              Dear Verity Madison Olivia Marks

              It's only been two months almost three months since I've met you and I've been continuous falling deeper and deeper in love with you. I'm not one to believe in fate as most things can be boiled down to coincidences, 
            but I cannot believe how lucky I am to have met you and to have made the recovery of a life time. You've made me so happy in such a short period of time it makes me excited for the future with you. 
            You are such a catch, you're the top brass with the phatest ass that has so much class. Although I will be missing you a ton, I'll be studying coding as well as earning my side beside you kicking ass in HellDivers. 
            I've got a workout plan so that I'm healthier for when you get back, I doubt I'll be a lot bigger by then but hopefully I am a little more toned. 
            Whenever you're thinking about me or god forbid missing me, just know I'm thinking about you in the moment too. You are living in my head rent free and you will never EVER be evicted. 
            You're the one bird I'll never let fly, but not in some over protective boyfriend type way, because I love watching you fly to your highest potential, I mean it in the love you so much and you mean the world to me type of way. 
            You're the beacon that shines so bright to illuminate this unforgiving universe we reside in, but I would not change this universe for any other. 
            This is the universe that has given us a chance to be happy together and I would not give it up for anything. I know you will have a great time, as you always bring so much energy to every situation you are in. 
            
            Mi luv yuh like a fat pickney luv cake.
            
            Je T'aime.... BEACOUP. 
            Vous allez me manquer
